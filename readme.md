# Predict Bike Sharing Demand With C# And ML.NET Machine Learning

This is a sample completed project based on Mark Farragher's Medium article [Predict Bike Sharing Demand With C# And ML.NET Machine Learning](https://medium.com/machinelearningadvantage/predict-bike-sharing-demand-in-washington-dc-with-c-and-ml-net-machine-learning-5550ca26c6df).

# What it does

Using sample test data from [Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) in Metro DC, the code will train a variety of ML models using 80% of the historical data, then test it using the remaining 20%.

# Usage

1. Clone the project locally
2. Download the latest test data from [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset)
3. Copy the `hour.csv` file into the same folder as the Bikes.csproj file
4. Run the command `dotnet run`
